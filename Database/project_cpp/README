   command line, in the order:  name price_per_lb roasting

      turing$ odbc_insert_item.exe  best_coffee 12 M 
   It connects to mysql to insert that item into the ITEM table.The program has the ID hard-coded,so you need to change the ID everytime you run your program. Nevertheless, this is just a sample to show you how Php with C++ can be used to access MySQL.
